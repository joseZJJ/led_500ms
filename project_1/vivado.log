INFO: [Labtools 27-2302] Device xc7a35t (JTAG device index = 0) is programmed with a design that has 1 ILA core(s).
WARNING: [Labtools 27-1347] Unable to find Debug Probes file []. Please update hw_device property [PROBES.FILE]
 Update of hw_probe objects, will be skipped.
WARNING: [Labtools 27-1974] Mismatch between the design programmed into the device xc7a35t_0 and the probes file(s) .
The device design has 1 ILA core(s) and 0 VIO core(s). 0 ILA core(s) and 0 VIO core(s) are matched in the probes file(s).
Resolution: 
1. Reprogram device with the correct programming file and associated probes file(s) OR
2. Goto device properties and associate the correct probes file(s) with the programming file already programmed in the device.
WARNING: [Labtoolstcl 44-129] No matching hw_ila_data was found.
